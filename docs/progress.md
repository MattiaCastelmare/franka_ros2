# Progress: initial circular tracking simulation

## 2026-11-04

### Objective

The 7-joint FR3 already configured in the repository tracks a circle in the
x-z plane, with a radius of 4 cm, a steady-state period of 8 s and a startup
ramp of 1 s. Only the position of `fr3_fingertip`, expressed in the robot
base frame, is controlled. The gripper orientation is free; the wall is
disabled in the launch command below.

### Simulation files

| File                                                       | Responsibility                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fr3_student_sim/students/circle_tracking/controller.py` | Cartesian position tracking with minimum-norm joint acceleration and computation of the seven joint torques. |
| `fr3_student_sim/students/circle_tracking/reference.py`  | New `CircleReference` class: desired circle position, velocity and acceleration, with a smooth startup.    |
| `fr3_student_sim/config/circle_tracking.yaml`            | Initial joint configuration, radius, period, ramp and controller gains.                                      |

The controller follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a &= \ddot{p}_{\mathrm{ref}}
   + K_d\left(\dot{p}_{\mathrm{ref}} - J\dot{q}\right)
   + K_p\left(p_{\mathrm{ref}} - p\right), \\
\ddot{q}_{\mathrm{cmd}} &= J^{\dagger}\left(a - \dot{J}\dot{q}\right), \\
\tau &= M(q)\ddot{q}_{\mathrm{cmd}} + c(q,\dot{q}).
\end{aligned}
$$


Gravity is already compensated by the simulator. The existing runner,
model, trajectory reference and launch file are reused without changes.

### Running the simulation

From the Ubuntu/WSL terminal:

```bash
docker start franka_ros2
docker exec -it franka_ros2 bash
```

Inside the container, after adding or removing package files:

```bash
cd /ros2_ws
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install --packages-select fr3_student_sim
source /ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
```

To start circular tracking:

```bash
ros2 launch fr3_student_sim student.launch.py \
  controller:=circle_tracking/controller.py \
  task_config:=/ros2_ws/src/fr3_student_sim/config/circle_tracking.yaml \
  wall:=false
```

The arguments select the new controller and its configuration without changing
the launch defaults. Running `student.launch.py` without arguments still
selects the existing `my_controller.py` skeleton.

Use `wall:=true` in the same command to include the existing compliant wall.

By default, the launch opens the Gazebo window, runs for 20 simulated seconds
after settling, uses a control rate of 1000 Hz and a real-time factor of 0.5.
Press `Ctrl+C` to interrupt the simulation. In each new shell, run
`source /ros2_ws/install/setup.bash`. Changes to files already installed with
`--symlink-install` only require restarting the simulation.

### Where to make changes

Edit `controller.py` to change the control law, `reference.py` to change the
trajectory reference and `config/circle_tracking.yaml` to change the parameters.
The existing infrastructure files and methods remain unchanged.
